                                                                   Assignment 2.3


1)Components of Hadoop 1.x

  HADOOP 1.x :
	1) HDFS stands for Hadoop Distributed File System. It is also know as HDFS V1 as it is part of Hadoop 1.x.
 	     It is used as a Distributed Storage System in Hadoop Architecture.
	2) It is built by following Google’s MapReduce Algorithm. It is also know as “MR V1” or “Classic MapReduce” 
 	     as it is part of Hadoop 1.x.

 COMPONENTS OF HADOOP 1.x :

               Master Node and Slave Nodes contain two Hadoop Components:
               1) HDFS Component
                   * Master Node’s HDFS component is also known as “Name Node”.
                   *Slave Node’s HDFS component is also known as “Data Node”.
                2)MapReduce Component
	 * Master Node’s MapReduce component is also known as “Job Tracker”.
                   * Slave Node’s MapReduce component is also known as “Task Tracker”.

1) HDFS :
	* HDFS is a Hadoop Distributed FileSystem, where our BigData is stored .
	* It is designed to work with Large DataSets with default block size is 64MB .
	* The two sub-components:
	   1)Name Node -
		 * Name Node is placed in Master Node. It used to store Meta Data about Data Nodes.
		 * Ex:Slave Node Details, Data Nodes locations, timestamps
	   2) Data Node-
		 * Data Nodes are places in Slave Nodes. It is used to store our Application Actual Data. 
		 * It stores data in Data Slots of size 64MB by default.
		
2) MAPREDUCE:
	* MapReduce is a Distributed Data Processing or Batch Processing Programming Model.
	*  It deals with “High Volume of Variety of Data at High Velocity Rate” 
	* The two sub-components:
	   1) Job Tracker -
                                      * Job Tracker is used to assign MapReduce Tasks to Task Trackers in the Cluster of Nodes.
		  * It reassigns same tasks to other Task Trackers as previous Task Trackers are failed.
		  * Ex: Up/running, Failed, Recovered.
	   2) Task Tracker -
		  * Task Tracker executes the Tasks which are assigned by Job Tracker .
		  * Task Tracker sends the status of those tasks to Job Tracker.
